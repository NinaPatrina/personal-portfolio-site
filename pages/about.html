                    <p>Hi, I am Nina. I moved to the United States from Russia. Before moving here, I had a very successful career in Moscow. I am a very highly educated woman who has a Master’s degree in investment management and a bachelor’s degree in civil law. Right after graduation from University I found a job in a back office of a small investment bank. In this first job I learned how the securities market works and after 2 years I passed a very competitive interview and started to work for the largest well known Russian investment company. I worked there in security settlements. 
                    I loved my job. I enjoyed the intense work environment, every day we faced a new challenge and the high salary and bonuses!  After that the company was sold to UniCredit group and I was promoted to the head of the Custody department. 
                        Then  I met my future husband and agreed to move after my husband to US. 
                         As things in Russia are getting really unstable politically over the last 10 years, we decided to stay here. We were fortunate and feel grateful to have had the privilege to became US citizens 6 months ago.
                        While raising my children, I continued to grow and develop new skills. 
                        My goal was always to return to work.
                        Now that all my children are in school, I finally have the space to seriously focus on my career. I have no interest in going backwards and trying to recreate my career from Russia, Instead I would like to focus on growing new skills and develop in a new field for the next 20 years.  Programming excites me and I am confident I will be excellent. </p>
